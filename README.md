# Stitch(ing) Calculator (or Planner)
## General Purpose/Goal Statement
The goal of this project to to develop a web driven crochet/knitting project planner, that allows for end users to create plans/patterns with greater ease and to automatically generate instructions based off of those plans. Ideally, this should cover the following things:

- Stitch ordering & count
- Net (flatpack) preview
- 3D/projected preview (later)
- Save project
- Load project
- Share project by link (optional)
- Edit by shape
- Simulate by sequence

This project intends for the application to be delivered by web to browser for maximal compatibility and portability, and to run majority client side for latency/performance.
